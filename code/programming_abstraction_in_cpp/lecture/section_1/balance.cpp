 * Balance (Code Write)
 * ----------------------------------
 * Write a function named checkBalance that accepts a string of
 * source code and uses a Stack to check whether the braces/parentheses
 * are balanced. Every ( or { must be closed by a } or ) in the opposite order.
 * Return the index at which an imbalance occurs, or -1 if the string is
 * balanced. If any ( or { are never closed, return the stringâ€™s length.
