# 1.Getting Started

**📌Good Practice On C++ Programming**

Often a single error can have a cascading effect and cause a compiler to report more errors than actually are present. It is also a good idea to <u>recompile the code after each fix</u>—or after making at most a small number of obvious fixes. This cycle is known as <u>***edit-compile-debug***</u>.



**📌Coding Style**

There is no single correct style but that there is value in <u>**consistency**</u>.
